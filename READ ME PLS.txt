Yeah, it's a bit late for this, but I'd like to point out that although it has been heavily modified at this point, this project's engine is forked from justinmeister's The Stolen Crown (https://github.com/justinmeister/The-Stolen-Crown-RPG). Please do check it out. I highly recommend it as a base for your own RPG, as the codebase is very clean and easy to understand; I analysed the entire thing on one fine day in spring break without any prior knowledge on pygame. Obviously, you want to ask for his permission first, as I did.
